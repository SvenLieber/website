In the last week of October 2019 I attended the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) in Auckland, New Zealand.
I had the honor to present my PhD plan at the ISWC Doctoral Consortium.
In this blog post I talk a bit about the conference and focus on a few presentations I found particular interesting or relevant for my PhD regarding guidelines for the design and use of ontologies.
<!--more-->

I will provide a bit of context, say what I liked/disliked and talk about a few talks which I found the most interesting/relevant for me and why.

The International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) is *THE* conference of research regarding the Semantic Web also covering Linked Data, Knowledge Graphs and AI.
This year it was held in Auckland New Zealand which on the one hand is an amazing venue, but on the other hand resulted in super long flights and visa issues for a lot of attendees.

**What I liked the most**
The conference also had sessions regarding ontology design which is relevant for my PhD.

**What I didn't like**
I missed a few really good workshops because I had to attend the Doctoral Consortium a full day. Fully attending it is a good thing, just a pity it overlaps with other workshops.

# OTTR tutorial
For the first workshop day I've chosen to attend the tutorial on [scalable construction of sustainable knowledge bases](http://ottr.xyz/event/2019-10-267-iswc/) which was all about the Reasonabble Ontology Templats (OTTR) framework.
It was given by [Martin G. Skj√¶veland](http://folk.uio.no/martige/), [Leif Harald Karlsen](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/personer/adm/leifhka/)  and [Daniel Lupp](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/people/aca/danielup/) from the University of Oslo,
and [Melinda Hodkiewicz]( https://www.uwa.edu.au/Profile/Melinda-Hodkiewicz) from the University of Western Australia.

In a nutshell OTTR is a language and a framework to describe knowledge on a conceptual level, whereas it abstracts from the actual knowledge representation in e.g. OWL.
Thus ontology engineers can communicate with domain experts in their language and talk about for example a Person without needing to know which concrete axioms are used to represent a person in OWL.
Templates contain parameters representing the variable part of a template which then gets extended to RDF together with its static part; working with templates feels like working with a constructor in languages such as Java. 

**I was particular interested in this tutorial as I see OTTR as the missing building block to generate different ontology representations based on the same conceptual model which is relevant for my PhD.**
The tutorial introduced the basics, we could get our hands dirty on some examples and then two real-life use cases were introduced.

Melinda Hodkiewicz stressed the need for ontologies in the Engineering sector, which she did as well in each session I have seen her during the main conference üôÇ
Which is nice, we need more enthusiastic people such as her to promote our work and highlight its concrete added value for businesses or the end user.

![Usge of menti.com to gather questions the audience would like to get answered by the tutorial](/img/2019-11-05-iswc-ottr-tutorial-feedback.jpg)

Besides the content I really liked the usage of https://menti.com to interactively get feedback from the audience such as demographics or incentives to join the tutorial.
And the end of the tutorial the organizers went back to the initially asked questions and incentives of the audience and it was discussed whether each point was addressed.
Thumbs up, please more of that in the future!

# Doctoral Consortium
A lot of workshops took also place at the second day but I didn't attend as I has the great pleasure of participating in the ISWC Doctoral Consortium all day where I could present the plan for my PhD.

The doctoral consortium started with a great keynote given by [Valentina Tamma](https://twitter.com/vtamma).
She started by defining what a PhD means according to its definition, i.e. doctor of philosophiae in Greek "love of knowledge", and continued with further details regarding the scientific process.
She recommended the book [Science in Action from Bruno Latour (1987)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_Action_(book)) and stressed that we should read a lot and talk about our research as much as possible, first to the broader community and then in lay terms also to the general public.

![Different dimensions of scientific investigations, a slide from the presentation of Valentina Tamma](/img/2019-11-05-iswc-dc-intro.jpg)

Each presenting PhD student got upfront a mentor assigned who gave feedback to the presentation, but of course everyone in the audience was invited to ask questions and provide feedback.
The presentations varied in quality and depth, but I think no one was able to present in the given time of 12 minutes (me included).
It actually is a challenging task to present your whole PhD research within 12 minutes, especially if you are in an early-stage and it is just a plan.

The presentations were supposed to be accompanied by a poster presented in poster sessions in the coffee breaks. However, due to the fact that no one finished in time with the presentation, the poster session was moved to the general poster session of the main conference on Monday.
Thanks to the chairs and local organizers to find some spare walls and arrange that we could present next to the main poster session.

A panel session rounded up the doctoral consortium. Several senior researchers discussed questions regarding the role of the PhD in industry, I will just briefly mention the questions and the main points:
    1. Which is your opinion with respect to this migration from academia to industry?‚Äù
        * Higher salaries and more stability in industry
        * Nowadays more opportunities in industry and a more research-influenced style of work
    1. From your experience, which is the actual need of industries in terms of innovation? Are they really believing in it or it is just a trend that they want to follow?
    1. May this new age of AI affect the programs of your PhD students?
    1. Do you think that a strong collaboration with companies would have a detrimental effect on the quality of research?

# Monday

At the first official conference day I participated in the opening session, the keynote by [Dougal Watt](https://nz.linkedin.com/in/dougalwatt), a session with industry talks and two sessions regarding data quality.

*Within the opening session* it was stated that from 194 valid research track submissions 42 papers were selected and thus the acceptance rate of the research track was 21.6%.
According to the presented statistics of submissions per topic in the research track (topics with more than 10 submissions) almost 80 submissions concerned database, information retrieval, information extraction and NLP.
Whereas Ontology Engineering and ontology design patterns for the web are the topics with the least submissions in this more-than-10 category.
It was a pity to see that the privacy topic was ranked in the statistics of topics with less than 5 submissions.

![The number of submissions per research track topic with more than 10 submissions](/img/2019-11-05-iswc-opening-stats.jpg)

Congratulations to [Olaf Hartig](https://twitter.com/olafhartig), [Christian Bizer](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-christian-bizer/), [Johann-Christoph Freytag](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yVGyEzIAAAAJ&hl=de) to win the SWSA Ten-year award with their work "Executing SPARQL Queries over the Web of Linked Data".
Also congratulations to [Julius Volz](https://juliusv.com/), Christian Bizer, [Martin Gaedke](https://twitter.com/gaedke) and [Georgi Kobilarov](https://twitter.com/gkob) to also win the SWSA Ten-year award with their work "Discovering and Maintaining Links on the Web of Data".

*Monday's keynote* was given by Dougal Watt and was titled "Semantics: the business technology disruptor of the future".
He gave a small tour through the different eras of information processing: from pre-literate and literate via the printed word to modern computing, the web and context nowadays.
Furthermore he talked about application centric thinking and about the different problems of relational databases, enterprise resource planning, enterprise data modelling, SOA and data warehousing.
Summarized these problems mainly focus on limited semantics, massively complex models, interoperability and missing schema agreement leading to a 28 minute discussion about definitions within a 30 minutes meeting.
Of course semantic technologies and ontologies offer a possible solution for these problems.
**But according to my opinion some of these problems still remain and are just shifted to how ontologies are modeled and how they are used, i.e. discussions of definitions and complex models.**

![The problems of application centric thinking in relational databases, enterprise resource planning, enterprise data modeling, SOA and data warehousing presented by Dougal Watt](/img/2019-11-05-iswc-keynote-dougal-application-centric.jpg)

Within the QA the topic data shapes and SHACL were brought up. Dougal said that SHACL shapes are fantastic things, as they can hide the complexity of ontologies which can then be used by businesses.
Personally I find this a very interesting point which is also relevant to my PhD: 
**Shapes become important components when working with ontologies and thus need also to be built systematically and/or considered when designing ontologies.**

[Evgeny Kharlamov](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/people/aca/evgenykh/) presented the work of colleagues regarding a knowledge-base for material science within the industry track.
Working in material science involves the creation of new materials for which knowledge of thousands of existing papers and patents need to be searched.
Queries such as which material X reacts with material Y and has its melting point below Z need to be asked.
An ontology was designed and a knowledge graph was built to facilitate the task of this search scenario.
Furthermore they are working on an end-to-end system including not only the ontology but also search interfaces for end-users.
I was interested in how the ontology was designed to deal with that task: apparently a lot of subclass axioms were used.
I like their use case in which they have to provide a user-friendly system powered by an ontology.
**As Dougal pointed out in his keynote: enterprise data modeling tend to create massively complex models. I would say that this enterprise modeling mindset still exists in the mind of some ontology engineers, a use case such as presented here shows that ontologies also have to be used by systems which also comes with extra requirements regarding their use.**


Within one of the *data quality sessions*, I listened to [Albert Mero√±o-Pe√±uela](https://twitter.com/albertmeronyo) who presented the work of him and his colleagues about RDF-lists.
MIDI applications (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) express songs as long lists of musical chords. 
In the context of this, the authors surveyed common list modeling practices taking e.g. different ontology design patterns for lists into account.
The authors reported coherent results among triple stores when evaluating the triple stores' performance when processing the different ways in which lists are currently represented.
The rdf:List is the only expression which produces "closed" lists, but it is also the one with the poorest performance.
**It is interesting to see that certain design decisions have an impact on performance. It actually shows that guidelines of how to implement an ontology for a certain use case are needed, i.e. in a use case in which performance is important the usage of rdf:List might not be optimal, whereas in a use case demanding more strict semantics the closeness of lists might be required.**




# Tuesday

On Tuesday, [J√©r√¥me Euzenat](https://moex.inria.fr/~euzenat/) presented the keynote *For Knowledge*.
He quotes that data without knowledge is like a map without a legend and stresses that explicit knowledge is important.
Also, *a great idea remains a great idea*.
Sometimes the time for an invention has not yet come and reinventing the wheel sometimes makes sense respectively invent different variants of a wheel.

Another interesting idea he proposes concerns eScience. 
Nowadays scientific experiments can be described semantically: why not submitting a detailed experiment description to conferences/journals to receive reviews purely on the scientific process and not the outcome?!

After the keynote a panel session took place. 
It was titled "How much semantics goes a long way", emphasizing on the *how much* with respect to the famous "a little semantics goes a long way" from [James Hendler](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~hendler/).
Valentina Tamma, J√©r√¥me Euzenat and James Hendler were the panel and the room was packed with senior SemWeb researchers.
The audience lively participated in this panel discussion.
I will briefly list *some* of the main comments.

  * The past 20 years demonstrated that different ontologies in the same domain can exist, people choose what they want and one ontology possibly becomes the lingua franca of that domain
  * There are obstacles; if technologies and languages are used which are too complex for people to use they won‚Äôt use it. That‚Äôs why expressivity might be reduced
  * A way to achieve consensus is maybe a more expressive language to express nuance and isolate which statement you agree with and to which not. So you might end up to agree
  * The problem is not about expressivity per se, but about the incentives to put the expressivity. E.g. in the research of genes, researchers put the expressivity in. We should ask, how to incentive the people to put the expressivity
  * How much semantics is perceived wrongly, choose either to define less or richer expressivity, but it depends! For certain tasks we don‚Äôt need much expressivity. Focus should be to make these different types to coexist with the same data
