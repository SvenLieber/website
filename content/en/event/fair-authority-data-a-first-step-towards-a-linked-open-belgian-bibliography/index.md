In this webinar for the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA)  I argue for structured Linked Data-ready data in library catalogues. This serves as a single source of truth and eases further steps towards Linked Open Data for example for the Belgian Bibliography. More specifically I talk about the opportunities of the MetaBelgica project that will provide FAIR authority data that can be used in the catalogue of KBR, the Royal Library of Belgium.
