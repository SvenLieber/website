# Frequently Asked Questions

{{< spoiler text="Do your blog posts provide metadata?" >}}
Yes! Next to standard metadata properties, there is a JSON-LD frame shipped with each blog post.
It contains standard metadata configured by Hugo, according to Schema.org.
Based on some extensions that I did, there are also Schema.org annotation linking the content to
other Linked Open Data sources such as Wikidata.

{{< spoiler text="Is the newsletter still active?" >}}
In short no. I started the newsletter in 2023 and consistently published new entries weekly/bi-weekly for almost half a year.
But since the birth of my daughter, my work-life balance has changed and thus no more newsletter editions.

{{< spoiler text="How is this blog build?" >}}
I use the open source software Hugo and its academic theme (wowchemy aka Hugo Blox) to statically create HTML files.
The source code of my website is available at GitHub: https://github.com/SvenLieber/website

{{< spoiler text="How can I cite a blog post?" >}}
All my blog posts are archived via [The Rogue Scholar](https://rogue-scholar.org/) and get a DOI. You can find the DOI badge at the beginning of each post or after the summary on overview pages.

{{< spoiler text="What is the blue DOI badge at the beginning of a blog post?" >}}
This is the persistent Document Object Identifier (DOI) of the blog post.
All my blog posts are archived via [The Rogue Scholar](https://rogue-scholar.org/) and get a DOI assigned.
Even if my blog at one point in time ceases to exist, the DOI link remains functioning and will forward you to the archived version of the post instead.
For now the DOI links of a post link to the post on my website.
