title: "BELTRANS - intra-Belgian literary translations between 1970 and 2020"

summary: "This project studies the untold history of literary translation flows in Belgium between French and Dutch in the period 1970-2020. BELTRANS examines the link between intra-Belgian cultural transfers and the mutual knowledge and perception of each other’s culture in a period of increasing regionalisation of the state, which caused a growing distance between Belgium’s linguistic and cultural communities."
