title: "FAST tracking e-government deployment through automated customer journey development"

summary: "Complicated rules, multiple contact points, numerous forms and applications and three administrative levels: processes as common as home renovations in Flanders require a lot of manual administrative work. To streamline customer journeys and simplify processes, municipalities and other public organizations would benefit from e-government applications. However, implementing these solutions is challenging, considering the lack of well-structured content and the need to integrate legacy systems. FAST aims to tackle the challenges to e-government adoption by creating an engine to automatically generate customer journeys from existing unstructured content – the ideal collection of digital interaction points between public services, organizations and citizens – for a range of public tasks."
