title: "MetaBelgica: A shared entity management infrastructure between Federal Scientific Institutes in Belgium"

summary: "This project aims to develop MetaBelgica â€“ a Linked Data platform of Belgian entities shared between Belgian Federal Scientific Institutions (FSIs) in the cultural heritage sector.
