title: BESOCIAL

summary: "The Royal Library of Belgium (KBR) has launched the BESOCIAL project, a two-year project that aims to set up a sustainable strategy for archiving and preserving social media in Belgium. The challenge is equally complex as the data: social media are challenging from the point of view of conservation, preservation and accessibility. This is due to their uniqueness and ephemeral nature in particular."
