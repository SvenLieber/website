# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Media companies in Flanders today have fragmented consumer data, with each company maintaining its own data management platform. As a result, data remains largely undervalorized. The EcoDaLo project aims to develop a knowledge platform for publishers allowing the integration of many diverse data sources. It will also define a business model for cooperative data products that complies with regulations and guarantees data ownership and privacy protection. These outcomes will lead to increased scale and thus competitiveness of local media companies, a healthier media ecosystem and a framework for other sectors in need of new ways of leveraging data."
